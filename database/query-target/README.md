# Query-Target Database Init Scripts

This directory contains initialization scripts for the **query-target** (consumer) database.

## Files
- `01-schema.sql` - Business schema (tables, indexes, constraints)
- `02-data.sql` - Generated by `download_data.sh` (not tracked in git due to size)

## Usage
The `02-data.sql` file is generated dynamically. Run:
```bash
./database/init-scripts/download_data.sh
```

Then copy to this directory if needed for isolated deployment.
